### Skin Lesion Classification with EfficientNetB4

## Overview
This project uses **EfficientNetB4** to classify 20 types of medically annotated skin lesions. The goal is to aid in early and accurate diagnosis using deep learning techniques and high-resolution dermatoscopic images.

---

## Technologies Used

This project was likely developed using the following tools and libraries:

* **Python:** The primary programming language for machine learning development.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for interactive development, analysis, and generating the report.
* **EfficientNet:** The core neural network architecture utilized in the project.
* **TensorFlow / PyTorch:** (Likely one of these) Popular deep learning frameworks for building and training the model.

### Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: `EfficientNetB4` (pretrained on ImageNet)  
- **Custom Layers**: GlobalAveragePooling2D ‚Üí Dense(Softmax)  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Input Shape**: 380x380 RGB  
- **Class Weights**: Applied to handle class imbalance

## Model Performance: F1-Score Summary

The model demonstrates strong classification capabilities across a variety of skin conditions. Below is a breakdown of performance using F1-score, a balance between precision and recall.

---

### Overall Averages

- **Macro F1-Score**: `0.64`  
  (Treats all classes equally, useful for imbalanced datasets)

- **Micro F1-Score**: `0.62`  
  (Weighted by class frequency, reflects overall performance)

---

### Top 3 Performing Classes (by F1-Score)

| Class                 | F1-Score |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Folliculitis          | 0.87     |
| Dyshidrotic Eczema    | 0.86     |
| Kaposi Sarcoma        | 0.83     |

These classes showed high precision and recall, making them the most accurately predicted.

---

### Bottom 3 Performing Classes (by F1-Score)

| Class                   | F1-Score |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Actinic Keratosis       | 0.45     |
| Seborrheic Keratosis    | 0.52     |
| Acne                    | 0.64     |

Lower F1-scores suggest the model struggled with consistent prediction, possibly due to class imbalance or visual overlap with other conditions.

---

## Overall Result Summary

This project fine-tuned **EfficientNetB4** on a multi-class skin lesion dataset comprising 21 conditions. The model was trained on 4,000+ images and evaluated on 1,700 test images.

- üìä **Final Test Accuracy**: **61.9%**
- üéØ **Macro F1-Score**: **0.64**
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Cohen‚Äôs Kappa Score**: **0.61** (moderate agreement beyond chance)
- üß™ **Training Time**: ~30 epochs (~4 minutes per epoch)
- üìâ **Early stopping** and **class weights** were used to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance.

The model shows **strong performance** on several classes (e.g., folliculitis, dyshidrotic eczema), but **struggles with imbalanced or visually similar conditions** like acne and actinic keratosis. Grad-CAM visualizations and confusion matrix analysis are suggested for deeper insight.

This model forms a solid baseline for further improvements, clinical exploration, or deployment in dermatology-related tools.
