# Equitable AI for Dermatology, Skin Lesion Classification with EfficientNetB4

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Spring 2025 Break Through Tech AI Studio** in collaboration with the **Algorithmic Justice League (AJL)**. Our goal was to build a machine learning model that promotes fairness in dermatology ‚Äî a field where AI systems often underperform for people with darker skin tones due to biased or incomplete training data.

Our team, UCLA AJL Team11, participated in a Kaggle competition where model submissions were evaluated using a **weighted F1 score**, accounting for class imbalance and diagnostic complexity. This model represents my contribution, which helped us score 4th place out of the 15 UCLA-affiliated teams in the Kaggle competition.

### Background: Algorithmic Justice League (AJL)

AJL combines art and research to expose the harms of AI systems that reinforce racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination. Their mission is to:

- Raise awareness about the social impact of AI
- Equip communities and researchers to resist bias
- Advocate for equitable, transparent, and accountable AI systems

This project builds upon AJL‚Äôs mission and contributes to broader research efforts on **fair AI in dermatology**, including work by Stanford and the MIT Media Lab.

## Model Performance: F1-Score Summary

The model demonstrates strong classification capabilities across a variety of skin conditions. Below is a breakdown of performance using F1-score, a balance between precision and recall.

---

### Overall Averages

- **Macro F1-Score**: `0.64`  
  (Treats all classes equally, useful for imbalanced datasets)

- **Micro F1-Score**: `0.62`  
  (Weighted by class frequency, reflects overall performance)

---

### Top 3 Performing Classes (by F1-Score)

| Class                 | F1-Score |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Folliculitis          | 0.87     |
| Dyshidrotic Eczema    | 0.86     |
| Kaposi Sarcoma        | 0.83     |

These classes showed high precision and recall, making them the most accurately predicted.

---

### Bottom 3 Performing Classes (by F1-Score)

| Class                   | F1-Score |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Actinic Keratosis       | 0.45     |
| Seborrheic Keratosis    | 0.52     |
| Acne                    | 0.64     |

Lower F1-scores suggest the model struggled with consistent prediction, possibly due to class imbalance or visual overlap with other conditions.

---

## Overall Result Summary

This project fine-tuned **EfficientNetB4** on a multi-class skin lesion dataset comprising 21 conditions. The model was trained on 4,000+ images and evaluated on 1,700 test images.

- üìä **Final Test Accuracy**: **61.9%**
- üéØ **Macro F1-Score**: **0.64**
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Cohen‚Äôs Kappa Score**: **0.61** (moderate agreement beyond chance)
- üß™ **Training Time**: ~30 epochs (~4 minutes per epoch)
- üìâ **Early stopping** and **class weights** were used to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance.

The model shows **strong performance** on several classes (e.g., folliculitis, dyshidrotic eczema), but **struggles with imbalanced or visually similar conditions** like acne and actinic keratosis. Grad-CAM visualizations and confusion matrix analysis are suggested for deeper insight.

This model forms a solid baseline for further improvements, clinical exploration, or deployment in dermatology-related tools.
